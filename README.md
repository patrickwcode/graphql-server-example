Apollo Server Intro

    I followed the Getting Started tutorial on Apollo's website: 
    https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/

    I am able to setup the Apollo Server, create a schema, and use the Apollo Server Sandbox to submit queries.
    My goal is to familiarize myself with Apollo and GraphQL more, since I am only familiar with REST.## Screenshots
